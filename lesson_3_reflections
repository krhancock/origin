When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    One might want to keep it safe in the cloud or saved as well on a remote as a safe guard.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    I would imagine it would get messy plus one might not want all of the inbetween work to be premanenate and open to the community.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Branches are when you take a new approach to a program but want to keep the existing program as well. Clones are when a user copies and program from GitHub and use it on their computer and then updates or changes it without interfering with the original. Forks is similar to clones but it is used when a user want to collaborate with other developers.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    The benefit would be good for the user and having a copy locally so you can edit and update. I guess.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    I am not sure, but Git and GitHub are what I have learned about and it appears to be a excellent option. There might be easier options, but I am sure Udacity would have introduced that to their students if it were better.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?
